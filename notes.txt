- Function on function multiple linear regression
    - Beta 1 will be a function of s and t: Constrain s and t => Historical FLM: s > t => beta = 0
- Assume the errors follow a Gaussian process (thus we can derive test statistics: the hypothesis that for all t, beta is 0)
- Renewable energy: Either get all countries for which we have data for or reduce the time span

Questions for Dr. Petersen:
1) If our functional covariates exist on the support S = [1990, 2020], should we also truncate our response variable to [1990, 2020]?
2) What does our functional box plot and FPCA plots actually tell us
3) Can we include dummy variables as a scalar predictor for country?
4) Should we describe the estimation procedure in our report?
